Ensure that your needs are clear and detailed in your call-off procedure documents. Step 3: Decide what type of call-off you want to use If you are using Lot 1 (Digital Programmes), you should decide if you are doing a one-stage or a two-stage further competition. If you are using Lot 2 (Digital Specialists), you should decide if you are doing a one-stage or a two-stage further competition or a direct award.

Two stage further competition You can shortlist the suppliers to find the ones most suitable for your procurement using a capability assessment tool. Only the suppliers on the shortlist will be invited to bid for your opportunity. Direct award Based on the supplier responses you receive, if you find a single supplier who can meet your needs you can choose to award your contract directly to them after completing a capability assessment. Step 4: Complete the call-off documents When you are ready to send your requirements to the market, and after reading the Public Sector Contract schedules, you will need to complete the call-off documents (also known as a bid pack), which is made up of: About the procurement How to bid Statement of Requirements Order Form Template and Call-Off Schedules (suppliers may need to review this during a direct award or further competition to understand which schedules will apply and which special terms have been included) Step 5: Issue the call-off documents You can invite either all suppliers in the lot you are using to a one-stage further competition, or the shortlisted suppliers during the second stage of a two-stage further competition after down selection (filtering) using the CAM tool at the first stage. For a direct award under lot 2, buyers will use the CAM tool and pricing tool to establish which supplier provides the most economically advantageous solution by using the ‘quality’ part of the direct award criteria to the CAM tool and the ‘price’ part of the direct award criteria to the pricing tool. To get the CAM tool and pricing tool contact us by email . You can use the free CCS eSourcing portal or your own procurement platform to start and complete a further competition or direct award. Step 6: Evaluation During your bid evaluation, you must treat all suppliers equally and fairly using the most economically advantageous tender criteria set out in your further competition documents. You must evaluate the bid as you described in the Call-Off documents and keep a clear audit trail of the process. Step 7: Award Once you have identified the most economically advantageous tender, we recommend you apply a standstill period of a minimum of 10 calendar days before awarding your contract. You must tell all the suppliers of the outcome of the further competition by email or letter. After the standstill is complete, you can place your order with the successful supplier by finalising and placing the completed order form (Framework Schedule 6).

This pre market engagement is always welcomed by the supply base and is a useful tool for customers to determine the best procurement route for its requirement. Direct award (Lot 1 only) To help you decide if you can use Direct Award, you need to consider the following questions: can your service requirements be met under the agreement? if so, does one supplier clearly provide the most economically advantageous tender (MEAT) in respect of your requirements? are all of your proposed contract terms laid down in the contract agreement and are you confident that the contract terms require no amendments or require any supplementary terms & conditions? are you content with the pricing model used in the procurement of the agreement and can you establish the total cost of each supplier for the requirement being sourced? If the answer to all the above questions is yes, then you can Direct Award using the Direct Award criteria stated in the guidance documents. If the answer is no to any of the above (for lot 1 only), then you should carry out a Further Competition to fulfil your specific requirements. Further competition (lot 1, 2 and 3) To prepare for a further competition, you need to consider what information you need to provide to suppliers and how this information will be communicated – the guidance documents will provide further details, however think about the following: have you adequately conducted pre-market engagement? do you need to form a project team? If so, who is the most appropriate person to lead it? have you formed a stakeholder group to formulate your requirements? have you identified specific resource to support the various stages of the project including initial data gathering, drafting of the statement of requirements and bid evaluation, working with the successful supplier to ensure a smooth implementation once the contract is awarded? who will approve the award once proposals have been evaluated? consider what information is required in order for supplier proposals to accurately reflect your future requirements Ahead of a further competition customers should have accurate and up-to date levels of information relating to for example; their card usage and user behaviour in order for suppliers to understand their current profile and to accurately respond to the further competition itself. The suppliers will also need to understand your ‘future’ requirements in order to respond effectively.

The steps below outline how to search for suppliers, create a shortlist and carry out a mini competition. Register as a buyer on the Dynamic Purchasing System Marketplace. Note: although pages are headed ‘Supplier registration’ this is also where you can register as a buyer. Navigate to the Quality Assurance and Testing for IT Systems 2 DPS under Technology and choose the ‘Access as a buyer’ option and confirm your acceptance of the customer access agreement. On your ‘Manage your DPS Category Exports’ page you now have 2 options: View appointed suppliers Click on the link to create a new category export. This is how you filter the suppliers that can meet your requirementsWhen creating a new category use the filtering tool (select all that apply) to specify your requirements and create your supplier shortlist. Save your filtered list of capable suppliers by clicking the ‘Save Category’ option and give the shortlist a unique name specific to your competition. From your ‘Manage your Category Exports’ page you can then export the list of suppliers and contact details (export is to an Excel spreadsheet) Quit the DPS. Use the list to run a Further Competition. Invite the suppliers identified by the DPS to bid against your detailed specification, evaluation criteria and contract format. The list is valid for only 2 working days , from the date of its creation, because new suppliers may apply to join at any point. If your Call for Competition excludes eligible suppliers it potentially breaches procurement regulations. You will need to get a fresh supplier list (steps 3.2 to 5) if you don’t use your list within 2 working days by clicking the ‘Search Again’ option for your export. You can use the CCS eSourcing tool to run a Call for Competition. The tool is free to use for public sector buyers, or you can use your organisation’s own procurement tool. Your tender process should be proportionate to the value and complexity of your requirement. Suppliers will need a reasonable period of time to review and prepare a response. This includes allowing sufficient time for suppliers to ask clarification questions and consider your answers before the deadline for written responses. Evaluate the responses. Request from winning supplier(s) any required evidence that they can meet your requirements. Set a 2-day deadline for submitting evidence . If you’re satisfied with the evidence, award the contract Where appropriate, notify of the award on Contracts Finder .","Quality, quality assurance, quality assurance and testing, qa testing, digital, devops, agile, test and release",PCR2015,Dynamic Purchasing System,"[{'description': '', 'title': 'Quality Assurance and Testing for IT Systems 2'}]"
